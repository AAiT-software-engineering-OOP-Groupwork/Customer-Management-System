# Customer-Management-System
he first requirement, manage business, residential, government, and educator types of customers, the noun that sticks out is customer. From the second requirement, manage our products, the noun is product. The third requirement, accept orders from customers online or through our call center, includes several nouns, but the important one for our purposes is order. In this case, each requirement identified one class. That may not always be the case. Some requirements may identify multiple classes or no classes at all. This step results in our first cut of classes. The Customer class manages the business, residential, government, and educator customers.
